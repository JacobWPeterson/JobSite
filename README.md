The user has the option to sign in as a job seeker or, using the toggle at the top right, an employer. If they do not have an account, they have the option to create one with 'Register.'

### Job Seeker Dashboard
The job seeker dashboard contains a non-detailed view of their resume, with the option to update their resume. To the right is a tab system that allows the to create reminders about upcoming jobs, review jobs they have saved from the job board, apply to those jobs, and create notes.

### Jobs Dashboard
This dashboard allows a job seeker to look at all of the available jobs on the site and filter them based on various criteria. If they click 'SAVE' on a job posting it moves the application to their profile dashboard.
